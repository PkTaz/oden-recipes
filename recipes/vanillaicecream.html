            <h2>The History of Vanilla Ice Cream</h2>
                <p>Vanilla ice cream was first documented all the way back to the 1600's
                    used by a woman called Anne Fanshawe, 
                    but was later introduced to the United States
                    by none other than 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>. Thomas Jefferson had visited France and discovered vanilla. 
                    He then brought the vanilla to the United States and created
                    vanilla ice cream!
