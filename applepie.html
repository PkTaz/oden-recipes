                <h2>The History of Apple Pie</h2>
        
            <p>To this day the earliest known recipe for a Apple Pie prototype
                is dated back to the early 1800's, but by the 1920's Apple Pie was beloved 
                in America. This is where the phrase <em>"About american as Apple Pie"</em> originated from.

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°. On a lightly floured surface, roll half of the dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle;
                     transfer to a 9-in. pie plate.
                     Chill while preparing filling. In a small bowl, combine sugars, flour and spices.
                     In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice.
                     Add sugar mixture; toss to coat.
                     Add filling; dot with butter.</li>

                <li>Roll remaining dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle. 
                     Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edge. 
                     Cut slits in top. Beat egg white until foamy; 
                     brush over crust.
                     If desired, sprinkle with turbinado sugar and ground cinnamon.</li>
                     
                <li>Bake on the lowest rack 60-70 minutes, until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly,
                     covering with foil halfway if crust begins to get too dark.
                     Cool on a wire rack.
                     If desired, serve with ice cream and caramel sauce.</li>
